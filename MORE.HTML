<br ></br>
- Ask questions: Inquire about the pet's health, history, and temperament. 
<br ></br>
- Consider the costs: Adoption fees often include vaccinations, microchips, and other veterinary care. 
<br ></br>
- Consider spaying and neutering: Consider the importance of spaying and neutering your pet.
